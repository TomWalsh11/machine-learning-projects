# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

In this project, I use **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** algorithms to predict whether individuals have heart disease or not, based on a 2020 medical dataset. The goal is to provide a machine learning model that can aid in early diagnosis and healthcare planning.

### 📊 Dataset:
The dataset contains various medical features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, which are used as input to predict the presence of heart disease.

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for predicting binary outcomes.
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble learning technique used for classification tasks.

This project demonstrates the application of these algorithms in a healthcare setting, focusing on model accuracy and interpretability.
