# TensorFlow Machine Learning Projects

This directory contains various machine learning projects developed using TensorFlow, focusing on real-world datasets and solving practical problems. The projects include deep learning models designed for classification, regression, and other predictive tasks. Key techniques such as neural networks, dropout regularisation, early stopping, and hyperparameter tuning are explored to build effective and optimised models.

### Projects in this Directory

1. **Quote Prediction Model**:
   - **Goal**: To predict the approval status of sales quotes using a deep learning model.
   - **Data**: A dataset containing information on sales quotes, including `Retail Price`, `Buyout`, and `Quote Status`.
   - **Approach**: Built a neural network model with multiple layers and dropout to prevent overfitting, evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.

2. **Loans Prediction Model** (under development):
   - **Goal**: Predict loan approval status based on various features.
   - **Approach**: Similar to the quote prediction model, this will involve cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using TensorFlow's Keras API.
