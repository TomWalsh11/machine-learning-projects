# üå∏ SVM for Iris Species Classification

In this project, I use **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify three species of **Iris** flowers based on their features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Used:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes.

The goal of the project is to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their physical characteristics, showcasing the power of SVM in multi-class classification problems.
