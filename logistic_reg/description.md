# 🔍 Logistic Regression for Advertisement Click Prediction

In this project, I use **Logistic Regression** to predict whether an internet user will click on an advertisement. The analysis is based on an **advertising dataset** that includes various features such as user demographics and ad characteristics.

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes, in this case, whether a user clicks on an ad or not.

The goal of the project is to build a model that can help marketers optimize their advertising strategies and improve ad targeting based on user behavior.
