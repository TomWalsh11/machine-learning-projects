# 🌳 Decision Tree for Loan Repayment Prediction

In this project, I use **publicly available lending data** from 2007-2010 to predict whether or not a borrower paid back their loan in full. The goal is to build a predictive model using **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** to classify borrowers based on their likelihood to repay.

### 📊 Dataset:
The dataset contains various loan-related features such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower credit history, and others, which are used to predict loan repayment status.

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- **Decision Trees**: A model that splits data based on feature values to classify outcomes.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees used to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

This project showcases how decision tree-based models can be applied to financial datasets for risk prediction and decision-making.
