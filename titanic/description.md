# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting survival outcomes from the Titanic disaster using machine learning. The dataset contains information about passengers, including features like age, gender, class, and fare, with the goal of predicting whether a passenger survived or not.

### Key Features
- **Logistic Regression**: Used as the baseline model for classification.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models for comparison and Kaggle submissions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Features like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features are part of the workflow.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training and evaluation.
- **Pandas, Numpy**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.

### Goals
- Predict survival probability using various machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate and compare models' performances on the Titanic dataset.
