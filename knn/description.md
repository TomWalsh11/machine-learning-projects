# 📊 KNN Clustering for Artificial Data

In this project, I apply the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to cluster artificially generated data into distinct groups. The goal is to demonstrate how KNN can be used for clustering and classification tasks based on proximity in feature space.

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, yet powerful algorithm used for classification and clustering tasks, where data points are grouped based on the majority label of their nearest neighbors.

This project showcases the use of KNN for unsupervised learning on artificial data to identify underlying patterns and groupings.
