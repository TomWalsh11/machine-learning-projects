# 🔢 K Means Clustering for College Data

In this project, I apply **K Means clustering** to group college data into two categories: **Private** and **Public** institutions. The goal is to use clustering techniques to segment the dataset based on various features and identify natural groupings in the data.

### 📊 Dataset:
The dataset contains various features of colleges, including acceptance rates, enrollment size, and graduation rates, which are used to classify colleges into private and public categories.

### ⚙️ Techniques Used:
- **K Means Clustering**: A clustering algorithm used to partition the data into groups based on feature similarity.

This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning techniques like K Means can be used to find patterns in educational data and classify institutions.
